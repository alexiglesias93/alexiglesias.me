title: Hey, ho, let's go!
subtitle: It was about time I released my own portfolio. This is the beginning of a (hopefully) nice blog.

<script>
import CoolAnimation from "./CoolAnimation.svelte";
import WritingImage from "../../WritingImage.svelte";

</script>

I gotta be honest, working on my own stuff is when I procrastinate the most. Eighteen months have passed since I purchased this domain.

<WritingImage src="/images/writings/hey-ho-lets-go/domain-receipt.webp" caption="My domain receipt after a compulsive purchase."></WritingImage>

And oh boi, it's been a struggle.

I've lost count of how many times I've rebuilt it from scratch. And it literally has only two pages, **Home** and **Writings**.
If you also have your own portfolio, you've probably felt the pain too.

That's nice, this means we have something in common 💪

Anyways, back to the topic. I'm planning to release whatever content I feel it's cool enough for others to appreciate it.
But I can already tell you it'll be either **Webflow**, **TypeScript** or **Svelte** related. I'm a big advocate of these three, so it makes sense to focus on them.

In fact, this very own website is built using **SvelteKit**, which gives me enough freedom to do nice stuff like this:

<CoolAnimation></CoolAnimation>

How cool is that? I've always loved learning from interactive content.

At this point I'd tell you to subscribe to my newsletter to get notified whenever I release new writings, but guess what, I haven't implemented that feature yet. I guess it'll take me another year or so.

Until then, thanks for reading dear stranger.
